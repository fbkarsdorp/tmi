<h1>Usage guide</h1>
<p>MIST provides an expressive and rich query system, allowing users to efficiently retrieve their results. Here you will find documentation about most of the essential features en search functionalities.</p>
<h2>Single word search</h2>
<p>Single word search is the simplest form of search: users search for a single word. The index retrieves all motifs containing the search word and ranks them according to how informative the word is for that particular motif. If, for example, a user searches for the word <em>devil</em>, the motif G303 ('Devil') will be ranked highest because it contains no other words than the word searched for. We describe single word search as the "simplest form of search". If a motif mentions a word more than once (for example motif G303.9.4.7.1 (Devil and girl. "Are you lonely?") Girl: "No, devil, with God and angels") mentions devil in both the primary description as in the additional information, leading to the high placement on the list of results. There is however another level to the simple search. Before the indexer performs its lookup, it expands each search word to its two direct hyperonymic parents as provided by WordNet. This means that if a user enters the search query <code>cat</code>, the system will also look for <code>feline</code> and <code>carnivore</code>. Note however, that because of the weights assigned to the different search fields, motifs matching only the expanded search terms will be ranked lower than those containing the term <code>cat</code>.</p>
<h2>Multi word search (Boolean operators)</h2>
<h3><code>OR</code></h3>
<p>By default all queries are represented as logically inclusive <code>OR</code> statements. This means that when a user searches for two words, e.g. <em>cat</em> and <em>transformation</em>, the index will search for all motifs containing either <em>cat</em> or <em>transformation</em>. Motifs that contain both search words are considered to be better matches and will be ranked higher than those containing only a single expression.</p>
<h3><code>AND</code></h3>
<p>To force the system to exclusively retrieve motifs containing both search terms, users need to add the boolean operator <code>AND</code>, as in <code>cat AND transformation</code>. Naturally this can be extended to as many search terms as the user requires.</p>
<h3><code>NOT</code></h3>
<p>To exclude a particular query term from the results, users need to add the boolean operator <code>NOT</code> preceded by <code>AND</code>, as in <code>magic AND NOT witch</code>.</p>
<h2>Field specific search</h2>
<p>By default, the index searches for matches of a particular word in all available fields (description, additional description, WordNet expansions, and references) using the field weights as described above. Users can override this default behavior by making explicit in which field they want to search. For example, to search for all motifs that mention a Chinese reference, one could issue the query: <code>ref:chinese</code>, where the search term is preceded by the expression <code>ref:</code>. Similarly, one could search for all motifs that contain words with the concept 'color' as one of its hyperonymic parents, but not the word <em>color</em> itself, using <code>wn:color</code>. Users can search the different fields individually using the following keywords, each followed by a colon:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>motif</code> (to search for motif ID's, e.g. <code>motif:A100</code>);</li>
<li><code>description</code> (to search for words solely in motif descriptions, e.g. <code>description:magic</code>);</li>
<li><code>additional</code> (to search for words solely in the additional descriptions of motifs, e.g. <code>additional:dragon</code>);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>references</code> (to search for words that are part of the references (e.g. sources or countries of origin) in the index, e.g. <code>references:Baughman</code>);</li>
<li><code>location</code> (to search for motifs based on their country of origin).</li>
</ul>
<h2>WordNet search</h2>
<p>One field specific search deserves a somewhat lenghtier explanation: the <code>wn:</code> option. This option is used to explicitely search for concepts available in the WordNet expansions, e.g. <code>wn:instrument</code>.</p>
<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<h2>Ngram search</h2>
